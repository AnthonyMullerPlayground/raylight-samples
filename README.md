# raylight-samples

I initiated this project to provide some samples about how people can interact with Web Intelligence RESTful API using different technologies. 

First implementation sample is using JAX-RS 2.0 Client API (Java8 required).

Second implementation sample is using Apache CXF WebClient API (Java6 required).
